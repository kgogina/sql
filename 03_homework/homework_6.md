**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

In my work with SQL and databases, it's important to include ethics and fairness. We need to protect personal data and keep it private, using strong security measures. We should also be clear with people about how their data is used and get their permission.

It's crucial to avoid bias in our data. This means making sure our data includes diverse groups of people and checking our analysis for any unfair patterns. When presenting data, it should be easy to understand for everyone, not just experts.

We should keep learning about new ethical issues and update our practices. Working with others in the field can help improve our standards.

Overall, handling data responsibly, being aware of biases, and presenting data clearly are key to making fair and trustworthy decisions with data.
